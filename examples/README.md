This directory contains some examples of what the filter can do.

For each example, there are a pair of files. One ends in `.gitignore`
and represents the input and the other ends in `.npmignore` and
represents the output. For example,
[`no-substitution.gitignore`](no-substitution.gitignore) processes
into [`no-substitution.npmignore`](no-substitution.npmignore).

Many of the examples in this directory are nonsensical. Some of them
are meant to help identity possible bugs and act as data files for the
test suite.
